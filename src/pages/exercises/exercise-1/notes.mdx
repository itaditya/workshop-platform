## Problems that you might face

#### 1. useState is not defined

This happens when you don't import `useState` from React npm package. Make sure
that the following code snippet is present in the playground.js file.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

#### 2. Test failed because data-testid="counter" is not found

For the tests to work you need to use the helper components present in the components.js
file. For your ease, they were already imported in the playground.js file.
